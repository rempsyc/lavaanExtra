# x.boot Extension Implementation Summary

## Implementation Overview

This implementation successfully addresses the investigation request for Christian Dorri's x.boot extension concept, providing comprehensive automatic indirect effects discovery for lavaanExtra.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. New Core Function: `discover_all_indirect_effects()`
- **Location**: `R/discover_indirect_effects.R`
- **Purpose**: Standalone function for discovering all possible indirect effects in SEM models
- **Algorithm**: Graph-based depth-first search with configurable parameters
- **Performance**: Includes computational safeguards and optimization options

### 2. Enhanced `write_lavaan()` Function
- **Location**: `R/write_lavaan.R`
- **Enhancement**: Added `indirect = TRUE` option for comprehensive discovery
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **New Parameters**: 
  - `auto_indirect_max_length`: Controls maximum chain length (default: 5)
  - `auto_indirect_limit`: Performance safeguard (default: 1000)

### 3. Three Indirect Effects Approaches Now Supported

#### Option 1: Comprehensive Discovery (NEW)
```r
write_lavaan(mediation = mediation, indirect = TRUE)
```
- Automatically discovers ALL indirect pathways
- No manual specification required
- x.boot-inspired comprehensive coverage

#### Option 2: Structured IV/M/DV (EXISTING)
```r
indirect <- list(IV = iv_vars, M = mediators, DV = outcomes)
write_lavaan(mediation = mediation, indirect = indirect)
```
- Maintains existing structured approach
- Requires clear IV/mediator/DV hierarchy

#### Option 3: Manual Specification (EXISTING)  
```r
indirect <- list(effect1 = c("path1", "path2"))
write_lavaan(indirect = indirect)
```
- Complete user control
- Custom effect definitions

## Technical Implementation

### Graph Traversal Algorithm
1. **Model Parsing**: Converts lavaan syntax to directed graph structure
2. **Path Discovery**: Uses depth-first search to find all indirect pathways
3. **Syntax Generation**: Creates lavaan `:=` statements for discovered effects
4. **Performance Controls**: Limits chain length and total effects for large models

### Algorithm Components
- `.parse_model_to_graph()`: Extracts relationships from lavaan syntax
- `.find_all_indirect_paths()`: Graph traversal for path discovery
- `.dfs_find_paths()`: Recursive depth-first search implementation
- `.generate_indirect_syntax()`: Creates lavaan indirect effect syntax

### Performance Optimizations
- Configurable maximum chain length
- Computational limits for large models
- Cycle detection to prevent infinite loops
- Early termination for performance

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Location**: `tests/testthat/test-x_boot_indirect.R`
- **Coverage**: 
  - Simple mediation models
  - Complex multi-mediator models
  - Performance limits and edge cases
  - Backward compatibility verification
  - Integration with existing functionality

### Test Cases Include
- Basic X → M → Y mediation
- Multiple mediator chains
- Complex multi-level models
- Computational limit validation
- Edge case handling (empty models, latent-only, etc.)
- Backward compatibility assurance

## Documentation
