# Investigation: x.boot Extension for Comprehensive Indirect Effects

## Overview

This document investigates the potential integration of an x.boot-like extension for automatically identifying and calculating ALL indirect effects in SEM models, as suggested by Christian Dorri in the Google Groups discussion.

## Current lavaanExtra Limitations

### Existing Implementation (`write_lavaan()`)
- **Structured Approach**: Requires explicit IV, M, DV specification
- **Limited Scenarios**: Only supports 3-level mediation designs
- **Manual Configuration**: Users must define mediation paths explicitly
- **Pattern-Based**: Works with specific documented scenarios

### Current Code Analysis
From `R/write_lavaan.R` lines 98-135:
```r
#### AUTOMATIC INDIRECT EFFECTS!!! ####
if (!is.null(indirect)) {
  if (all(names(indirect) %in% c("IV", "M", "DV"))) {
    # Current implementation generates indirect effects for predefined IV->M->DV patterns
    # Limited to specific mediation structures
  }
}
```

## x.boot Extension Concept

### Theoretical Approach
Based on Christian's description, the x.boot extension would:
1. **Automatically identify** all possible indirect pathways in a model
2. **Not be limited** to simple x→m→y patterns  
3. **Discover complex mediation chains** automatically
4. **Be computationally intensive** but comprehensive
5. **Similar to Amos functionality** for indirect effects

### Key Advantages
- No manual specification of mediation paths required
- Comprehensive coverage of all indirect effects
- Supports complex multi-level mediation models
- Reduces specification errors

### Challenges
- Computational complexity
- Need for efficient algorithms
- Integration with existing lavaanExtra workflow
- Performance optimization requirements

## Enhanced Indirect Effects Design

### Proposed Algorithm
1. **Model Parsing**: Parse lavaan model syntax to identify all paths
2. **Path Discovery**: Identify all possible indirect pathways using graph traversal
3. **Chain Detection**: Find all mediation chains of any length
4. **Effect Generation**: Generate lavaan syntax for all discovered indirect effects
5. **Optimization**: Implement efficiency improvements

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Algorithm
```r
# Proposed function signature
discover_all_indirect_effects <- function(model, 
                                        max_chain_length = 5,
                                        exclude_patterns = NULL,
                                        computational_limit = 1000) {
  # Parse model into graph structure
  # Identify all indirect pathways
  # Generate lavaan indirect effect syntax
  # Return comprehensive indirect effects list
}
```

#### Phase 2: Integration with `write_lavaan()`
- Add new parameter: `auto_indirect = FALSE`
- When enabled, automatically discover all indirect effects
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing approach
- Allow hybrid usage (manual + automatic)

#### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- Implement path caching
- Add computational limits
- Optimize graph traversal algorithms
- Provide progress indicators for large models

## Technical Specifications

### Graph-Based Approach
1. **Model to Graph**: Convert lavaan model to directed graph
2. **Path Enumeration**: Find all paths between variables
3. **Indirect Identification**: Filter for indirect paths (length > 1)
4. **Syntax Generation**: Create lavaan `:=` statements

### Expected Interface
```r
# Enhanced write_lavaan() usage
model <- write_lavaan(
  latent = latent_vars,
  regression = regressions,
  auto_indirect = TRUE,           # NEW: Enable comprehensive indirect effects
  max_indirect_length = 4,        # NEW: Limit chain length
  computational_limit = 500       # NEW: Performance safeguard
)
```
