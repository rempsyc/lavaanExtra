\title{Extract relevant fit indices from lavaan model}
\usage{
nice_fit(
  model,
  model.labels,
  nice_table = FALSE,
  guidelines = TRUE,
  cutoffs = guidelines,
  stars = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{lavaan model object(s) to extract fit indices from}

\item{model.labels}{Model labels to use. If a named list is provided
for \code{model}, default to the names of the list. Otherwise, if the list
is unnamed, defaults to generic numbering.}

\item{nice_table}{Logical, whether to print the table as a
\link[rempsyc:nice_table]{rempsyc::nice_table}.}

\item{guidelines}{Logical, if \code{nice_table = TRUE}, whether to display
include reference values based on Schreiber (2017), Table 3, at the
bottom of the table.}

\item{cutoffs}{Logical, if \code{nice_table = TRUE}, whether to display
suggested fit index cutoffs at the bottom of the table. Defaults to
same value as \code{guidelines}. Setting this to \code{FALSE} provides a way to
hide cutoffs while keeping other guideline information.}

\item{stars}{Logical, if \code{nice_table = TRUE}, whether to display
significance stars (defaults to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to display messages and warnings.}
}
\value{
A dataframe, representing select fit indices (chi2, df, chi2/df,
p-value of the chi2 test, CFI, TLI, RMSEA and its 90\% CI,
unbiased SRMR, AIC, and BIC).
}
\description{
Compares fit from one or several lavaan models. Also
optionally includes references values. The reference fit values are
based on Schreiber (2017), Table 3.
}
\details{
Note that \code{nice_fit} reports the unbiased SRMR through
\code{\link[lavaan:lavResiduals]{lavaan::lavResiduals()}} because the standard SRMR is upwardly
biased (\doi{10.1007/s11336-016-9552-7}) in a noticeable
way for smaller samples (thanks to James Uanhoro for this change).

If using \code{guidelines = TRUE} or \code{cutoffs = TRUE}, please carefully consider the following 2023
quote from Terrence D. Jorgensen:

\emph{I do not recommend including cutoffs in the table, as doing so would
perpetuate their misuse. Fit indices are not test statistics, and their
suggested cutoffs are not critical values associated with known Type I
error rates. Numerous simulation studies have shown how poorly cutoffs
perform in model selection (e.g., Jorgensen et al., 2018). Instead of
test statistics, fit indices were designed to be measures of effect size
(practical significance), which complement the chi-squared test of
statistical significance. The range of RMSEA interpretations above is more
reminiscent of the range of small/medium/large effect sizes proposed by
Cohen for use in power analyses, which are as arbitrary as alpha levels,
but at least they better respect the idea that (mis)fit is a matter of
magnitude, not nearly so simple as "perfect or imperfect."}
